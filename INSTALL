Installation Instructions for MD5Awsum:

1. To compile MD5AwSum, simply type in "make".
2. An executable will be created in the directory.
3. Type "make clean" to delete the build files as well as the executable.

Specialized Instructions:

	Upon modification of a specific part of the project, one can recompile only
the necessary part of the project using "make <partname>" and then "make MD5AwSum".

For example:
	I create the project using "make". I modify a function in "md5lib.cpp". I then
issue the command "make md5lib" followed by "make MD5AwSum" and the project will
be recompiled without having to recompile every single file.

NOTE: always "make clean" BEFORE using "git add ." or pushing to the repository!!!
